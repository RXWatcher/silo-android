/**
 * Kicks an outbox drain on app launch, when connectivity returns, and when the
 * active server changes — so ops left pending by a previous session, by an
 * offline period, or by a scope the worker wasn't draining when they were
 * queued, all sync without waiting for a fresh mutation. The mutation path
 * already enqueues on `resolve(RETRIABLE)`; this covers the "reopened / back
 * online / switched back" cases.
 *
 * Used by both the phone and TV `Application`s (both perform content-level
 * mutations). Enqueues are unique-KEEP, so concurrent triggers coalesce.
 *
 * Known limitation (documented, not data-loss): while a retry chain for one
 * scope is backing off, `KEEP` can briefly defer an immediately-due op until the
 * chain's next tick. A dedicated scheduler would close that latency gap; the op
 * is never lost.
