/**
 * `PublicDownloadCollection.relativeRoot` is written as literals so the enum can
 * be constructed in plain JVM unit tests, where `android.os` statics are
 * unavailable and would fail class initialisation.
 *
 * MediaProvider validates `RELATIVE_PATH` against its own allow-list, so a value
 * that drifts from the platform constant is rejected with
 * `IllegalArgumentException` — which `DownloadWorker` treats as permanent
 * failure. That is exactly how the plural "Downloads" made every ebook download
 * fail on API 29+. Pin the literals to the real constants here, under
 * Robolectric, so the two can never diverge again.
