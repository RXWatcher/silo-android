/**
 * Regression cover for a playback-killing crash seen on a Google TV Streamer:
 *
 * ```
 * ExoPlaybackException: Unexpected runtime error
 *   Caused by: NullPointerException: MediaPeriodHolder.info
 *     at ExoPlayerImplInternal.seekToCurrentPosition
 *     at ExoPlayerImplInternal.reselectTracksInternalAndSeek
 * ```
 *
 * An HDMI audio-route change ("Audio output capabilities updated: codecs=[]
 * maxChannels=2") re-fired the track-selection effect while the player was
 * being torn down. ExoPlayer applies a reselection by seeking the current media
 * period, and there was none left to seek, so playback ended in ERROR(7).
 *
 * The rule: never hand a reselection to a player that has nothing to apply it
 * to. Presets are re-applied when the next player is built, so withholding them
 * here loses nothing.
