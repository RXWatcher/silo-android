 * What to do with a pairing request that names the server which issued it.
 *
 * A pairing code is only meaningful on its own server. The origin used to be
 * discarded and the code looked up against whichever server happened to be
 * active, which normally reported a perfectly valid request as invalid or
 * expired. Refusing that is right — but refusing it *silently* just moves the
 * confusion, so the request is still delivered and the screen explains itself.
