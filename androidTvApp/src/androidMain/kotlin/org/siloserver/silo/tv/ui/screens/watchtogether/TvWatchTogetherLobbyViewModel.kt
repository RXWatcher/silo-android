/**
 * Backs [TvWatchTogetherLobbyScreen]. Binds the per-room websocket on enter so
 * snapshots/suggestions flow into the state flows, and exposes vote / unvote /
 * host-promote / host-pick / policy / close-room ops. Mirrors the phone
 * [org.siloserver.silo.android.ui.screens.watchtogether.WatchTogetherLobbyViewModel].
 *
 * The repository owns the room JWT and reads the active roomId from its own
 * snapshot, so the room-scoped ops take only request/id params (not a roomId).
 * [WatchTogetherRepository.connect] is suspend and runs the reconnect-with-backoff
 * loop until the scope is cancelled, so it is launched in [viewModelScope] (NOT
 * called bare in init).
