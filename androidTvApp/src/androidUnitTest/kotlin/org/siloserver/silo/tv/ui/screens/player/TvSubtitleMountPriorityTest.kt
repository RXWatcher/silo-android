/**
 * TV drives subtitle mounting from two pipelines at once: the subtitle
 * transaction, and the legacy restore/auto machinery that reacts to track
 * changes. They share a single remount latch, and a transaction's own replan
 * republishes the track list — so the legacy pipeline reliably fires *after*
 * the transaction and used to overwrite the selection the user just made.
 *
 * Authority, not timing, decides who owns the mount.
