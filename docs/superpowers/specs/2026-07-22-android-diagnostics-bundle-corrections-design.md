# Android Diagnostics Bundle Corrections

## Context

Inspection of a real manual report from the Google Streamer showed that upload and archive integrity work, but several fields lose diagnostic value before the bundle reaches the server:

- playback failures are recorded only as a generic event;
- recent playback session IDs are absent;
- manual log categories collapse to `other`;
- `bytes_gz` is always zero;
- a permissive JWT pattern redacts dotted codec names; and
- network paths collapse valid endpoint families into `other/{id}`.

The correction must improve correlation without admitting media names, raw URLs, media/content/file identifiers, query strings, tokens, or server-provided prose into diagnostic evidence. Opaque playback-session IDs remain permitted solely for server-log correlation, as in the parent diagnostics design.

## Design

### Structured playback evidence

`VideoPlaybackStartResult.Error` will carry an optional diagnostics-only failure code in addition to its existing user-facing message. Starters will populate that code only from a bounded, normalized value: a server terminal reason such as `no_alternate_version`, or a client-owned constant for known local failure classes. Arbitrary exception text and server messages remain excluded.

`VideoPlaybackSessionCoordinator` will emit the failure code through a narrow `DiagnosticsPlaybackLogger` API. The playback attribute registry will allow only the new safe field.

### Recent playback session correlation

A process-local, thread-safe tracker will retain at most 20 recent playback session IDs, each bounded to 128 characters. `PlaybackSessionLifecycle` will record an ID whenever it adopts or starts an active session.

Manual reports and crash runtime snapshots will read the tracker. The tracker will be cleared whenever the diagnostics identity/privacy gate closes, preventing IDs from crossing server, account, profile, consent, or ownership boundaries.

### Accurate log summaries

A pure summary helper will inspect the redacted JSONL that is actually included in a report. It will calculate:

- newline count;
- gzip byte count;
- distinct recognized categories; and
- existing dropped-line/debug flags supplied by capture state.

Malformed lines will still count as lines but will not invent categories. Empty logs produce zero lines, zero compressed bytes, and no categories.

Manual capture will use this helper for pending-report metadata. Bundle construction will recompute the summary after its final redaction pass so the embedded manifest describes the exact `logs.jsonl` bytes shipped to the server.

### JWT redaction

JWT detection will require three base64url segments whose decoded header and payload are JSON objects. This preserves redaction for real JWTs while leaving dotted decoder and codec identifiers such as `c2.android.aac.decoder` intact. Explicit sensitive-value redaction remains unchanged.

### Network route templates

Network diagnostics will use an allowlisted route-template matcher. It may preserve known static endpoint segments, for example `/api/v1/playback/start` and `/api/v1/playback/route-events`, while replacing dynamic identifiers with `{id}`. Query strings, fragments, malformed paths, and unknown endpoint families continue to collapse to safe generic routes.

### Performance evidence

Detailed and timed captures will enable a low-overhead Android-native performance recorder for phone and TV. It will aggregate rather than log individual frames or callbacks. Ten-second foreground snapshots will contain:

- frame count, slow-frame count, p95 frame duration, and worst frame duration;
- main-thread stall count and longest observed stall;
- Java heap use, process proportional-set-size memory, low-memory state, and thermal status; and
- only the allowlisted route identifier already maintained by diagnostics lifecycle instrumentation.

The recorder will retain process-start-to-first-frame timing as one process-local scalar so a capture started after launch can still include startup evidence. Frame timing, heartbeat, memory, and thermal sampling otherwise run only while detailed capture is enabled and a Silo activity is foregrounded. Native `FrameMetrics`, main-loop scheduling, `Debug.MemoryInfo`, `ActivityManager`, and `PowerManager` APIs avoid a third-party telemetry dependency.

Playback performance will extend the existing Media3 analytics aggregate with start-to-ready and first-frame timing, rebuffer count/total/maximum duration, seek completion duration when both endpoints are observable, bandwidth estimate, buffered duration, and final cumulative dropped-frame and audio-underrun counts. Periodic snapshots and the final session aggregate are emitted only while detailed capture is enabled.

Performance evidence remains local until included in a consented report. It is diagnostic logging, not continuous analytics or remote telemetry.

## Privacy and lifecycle invariants

- Never log content IDs, file IDs, media titles, raw URLs, query strings, request/response bodies, server messages, exception messages, tokens, or arbitrary attributes.
- Session IDs remain bounded correlation identifiers and are cleared at every diagnostics gate transition.
- Unknown failure reasons and paths degrade to generic values instead of being copied through.
- All manifest summaries describe already-redacted artifacts.
- Performance records contain numeric aggregates and allowlisted route names only; they never contain view text, media identity, user interaction text, stack sampling, screenshots, or per-frame traces.

## Verification

Focused unit tests will cover structured failure propagation, tracker bounds and clearing, manual and bundled summaries, real-JWT versus codec-name behavior, static/dynamic route sanitization, frame/stall aggregation, capture gating, startup timing, resource sampling, and Media3 playback timing reduction. Existing diagnostics privacy and bundle tests plus Android shared tests will then run as regression coverage.
